there is quite a clear difference between using flex and grid...
if you do use flex to make a three column
and you need to add more content on say the second column like another post or article
it will not break to the next line because you did a flex inline(default) from line 1. which doesnt break to next line, rather it lines up the next
article to the previous one, like a two column newspaper

if you do a grid layout
you have the flexibility to define how much the column for the article takes and make the row auto so it flows accordingly to the content height

if you add another article beneath it, it will continue downwards...this is because the article has already being defined to go on a defined column track

i.e

about-me col- 1/3, row-1

article col-3/9, row-auto

tag col 9/12, row-1
