                        Let’s analyse the transmission of information on social media.
                        So I just saw information stating that- Mr X is proposing to take a second wife. Now this information spreads like fire
                        and almost everyone is talking about it, including those who do not have a phone.
                        Now Mr X got to even know about this information from someone, who frequents the social media or is more to the public
                        than Mr X. his family members also got to know about the fast spread of this information.
                        There is a rise of contempt among the family members who have not yet heard from Mr. X directly or was informed. But got
                        to know from the social media or the public.
                        Mr.X could be worried, he might have planned to take a second wife, but maybe not to let the public know about it soon
                        or he might not even have plans to take a second wife.
                        To the family concerned about this, they are worried, they probably begin to hate on the situation.
                        The spread of this information begin to get them worried.
                        Mr. X needs to let them know whether it’s a rumour or genuine
                        First before this information got to the public and spreads like fire. Someone got kerosene and maybe another got the
                        matches and maybe another lit the matches after pouring the kerosene.
                        Yet we hardly know of this person, who spread this information. This is the only person who should be responsible enough
                        or held responsible for the consequences of this spread and should be the person who should debunk the information or
                        authenticate it when called upon.
